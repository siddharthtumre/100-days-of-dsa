This series of blogs are to keep track of all the learnings as part of **100DaysOfDSA**. At the end it will be a good place to revise everything that I had learned during the period. I will be uploading one blog each day with listing the concepts I learned and problems I solved along with code and references if any.

Previously, I had a little bit of experience with competitive coding and I am aware of the concepts in *Data Structures and Algorithms*. I have been coding in python for a very long time. But, I have decided to code in C++. I will be trying to solve problems from different platforms and from different topics. And also spend time on understing topics which I am not good at. Also, some questions might repeat after a few days as we know reinforcement learning is the best for long term.

Below are some platforms from which I will be coding regularly.
1. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) (*most of the time*)
2. [InterviewBit]((https://www.interviewbit.com/practice/) (*almost equal time as Leetcode*)
3. [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) (*most of the time for contests (to increase ratings) and sometimes for practice*)
4. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
5. [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/)

Also I will be following the [Striver's SDE sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) and try to complete all the problems in it by the end of 100 days.

Few more resources:
1. [coding interview university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university): This repo has covered all the topics from basics to advanced and also has references to videos for topics.
2. [Cracking the Coding Interview book](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/0984782869/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=A15DBATYR506U3&psc=1)
